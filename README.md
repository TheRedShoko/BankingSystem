# BankingSystem
A project for the OOP course in FMI Sofia University

The project focuses on the implementation of banking software. The system has a console interface, and communication with the user is done through commands. The software allows the average user to check their account balance and make transactions. The software product also requires the bank's employees - to manage the accounts of ordinary users and to issue reports, and the system administrators - to manage the employees' accounts.
